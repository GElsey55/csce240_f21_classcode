## Strings

**Important** To use a string in C++, you must include the header for the string library: 
```
#include <string>
```
Remember that a C++ string is not a primative type. This means that it has functions and properties associated with it. For a full list, see the documentation here: <https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/>
