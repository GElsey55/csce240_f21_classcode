# Lecture 2 - C++ Basics

## Processing a C++ Program
1. Text editor to write the source code
2. Include preprocessor directives (start with a #)
3. Compile the code (checks for syntax errors then translates to machine language)
4. Execute the program (linker, then loader and then execution)
    * Linker - combines your program with any libary code needed
    * Loader - Loads executable into main memory so that it can run!

## Anatomy of a C++ Program
The most basic C++ program (Hello World!)
```
#include <iostream> 

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    std::cout << "Hello World! << std::endl;
    return 0; 
}
```

Breaking it down line by line...

The following includes the header to the iostream library, namely, defines the standard input/output stream objects.
```
#include <iostream>
```
The following is the main function (the main driver of the software). Notice it returns 0 (we will talk more about other options later). 
```
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    ...
    return 0
}
```
The following prints out Hello World! to the terminal (standard out). Notice the `std::`, this is specifying which namespace to look for the cout command. This `std::` is going to become quite tedious. However, it is better than the alternative (which you will see often in code) - adding a `using namespace std;` statement at the top of the file. This loads in the whole library. A lot of added overhead here. 
```
std::cout << "Hello World! << std::endl;
```

---

## I/0 (Standard in and out)
`std::cout` will print to standard out (the terminal)

`std::cin` will read in input from standard in (the terminal again)

`<<` stream insertion operator (put stuff into the stream to print out)

`>>` stream extraction operator (take stuff out of the stream and put it into your program)

Can be cascaded. For example, in the following code, if the numbers 4 and 5 are entered on the terminal by the user then the variable `a` will hold 4 and the variable `b` will hold 5.
```
int a(0), b(0); 
std::cin >> a >> b;
```

### Note about `std::`
This `std::` is specifying that we want to use the `cout` or `cin` from the std namespace. You will also see in C++ code the statement `using namespace std`. This is, in general, a bad practice because it will potentially cause unintended issues later if you want to reference a function of the same name from another context. We can potentially make things a bit easier by using a typedef statement. 
```
typedef std::cout cout_std; 
```
Now we can refer to just cout_std instead of std::... but... that is kind of the same amount of typing so, up to you.

## Basic Data Types

The following are the basic data types in C++:

*Note that this table says 1 bit for a bool, but in reality, it is actually a full byte* 

### auto keyword
(also sometimes called type inference) is a feature that allows the compiler to deduce the type of an object from the objectâ€™s initializer.

In the example below, the variable `a` has the type of int because we assigned a number `1`:
```
auto a = 1;
```
We will use this auto keyword a lot more when talking about iterators and the standard template library. It will make lives easier. It will mean a slightly slower compilation time, but not much.

## Arrays
Primative arrays in C++ can be defined using the following general form: 
```
type name[] = {init value(s)
```
For example, the following would create an array of 3 ints with the values 1, 2, and 3 in positions 0, 1, and 2
```
int arr[] = {1,2,3};
```
N-D Arrays can be created by increasing the number of square brackets! For example, this is a 2x3 array (2 rows and 3 columns) with values of 0 for the first row and 1s for the second. 
```
int arr[2][3] = { {0,0,0}, {1,1,1} };
```
You can increase to more dimensions as well!

## if / else statements
Typical if/else if/else statement. Very similar to other languages.

Syntax:
```
if(conditional){
   actions
}
else if(some other conditional){
   actions
}
else {
   actions
}
```
In the following example, "Yay" will be printed if `number` is between 0-1, "Hi" if `number` is between 2-4 and "Boo" if `number` is anything else. If you test this code with `number = 2` then it should print "Hi".
```
int number = 2; 
if(number >= 0 && number <=1) {
   std::cout << "Yay";
}
else if(number >= 2 && number <=4) {
   std::cout << "Hi";
}
else {
   std::cout << "Boo";
}
```

## switch statement
Typical switch statement. Very similar to other languages.

Syntax:
```
switch(variable) {
   case cond1 : 
      //do something
      break;
   case cond2 : 
      //do something
      break;
   default: 
      //do something
}
```

The following example will switch on a char. Since `c` starts as 'A', "You got an A!" will print. 
```
char c = "A";
switch(c) {
   case "A":
      std::cout << "You got an A!"; 
      break;
   case "B":
      std::cout << "You got an B!"; 
      break;
   default: 
      std::cout << "You did not get an A or B"; 
      break;
} 
```

## while loops
Typical while loop. Very similar to other languages.

Syntax:
```
init step 
while(condition) {
   //do something
   update step 
}
```

The example below will print 0 to 9:
```
int i = 0;  
while(i < 10) {
   std::cout << i << " "; 
   i++;
}
```

Typical do-while loop. Very similar to other languages.

Syntax:
```
init step 
do{
   //do something
   update step 
}while(condition);
```

The example below will also print 0 to 9:
```
int i = 0;  
do{
   std::cout << i << " "; 
   i++;
}while(i < 10);
```

**Remember that a do while loop will always execute once, whereas a while loop may not if the condition is not satisfied!**

## for loops
Typical for loop. Very similar to other languages.

Syntax:
```
for(init step; condition; update){
   //do something
}
```

The example below will also print 0 to 9:
```
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
   std::cout << i << " "; 
}
```

## Difference between post and pre increment
The pre-increment (`++i`) will increment first and then print or be assigned to a variable. 

In the example below, the value of `i` will be 1 when it prints. 
```
int i = 0; 
std::cout << ++i; 
//i is now equal to 1
```

The post-increment(`i++`) will first print or be assigned to a variable and then increment. 

In the example below, the value of `i` will be 0 when it prints. However, it will actually be incremented to 1, so if we printed `i` again we would get a 1. 
```
int i = 0; 
std::cout << i++; 
//i is now equal to 1
```
